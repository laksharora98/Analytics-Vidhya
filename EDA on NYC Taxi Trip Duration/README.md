This is a project to learn Exploratory data analysis by doing it on the NYC Taxi Trip Duration [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AYgg6_bTxW84Ip5Yhs0jhEsn88nFot6z/view?usp=sharing)

The .ipynb file can be opened as a jupyter notebook. The dataset should be present in the same folder as a .csv file.

In this project we do the following:

* Variable Identification and Typecasting
* Feature Engineering to create new features
* Univariate Analysis: Continuous and Categorical
* Outlier Analysis
* Bivariate Analysis: Continuous-Continuous, Continuous-Categorical and Categorical-Categorical
