This is a project to Recommend movies using partial MovieLens dataset.

The .ipynb file can be opened as a jupyter notebook. The dataset should be present in the same folder as a .csv file.

In this project, I did the following:

* User based Collaborative Filtering:
    * Grid Search for best parameters
* Item based Collaborative Filtering:
    * Grid Search for best parameters
* Collaborative Filtering using Matrix Factorisation:
    * Grid Search for best parameters

Matrix Factorisation (SVD) performs the best with just one latent factor!
