This is a project to learn Linear Regression by doing it on the NYC Taxi Trip Duration [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AYgg6_bTxW84Ip5Yhs0jhEsn88nFot6z/view?usp=sharing)

The .ipynb file can be opened as a jupyter notebook. The dataset should be present in the same folder as a .csv file.

In this project we do the following:

* Feature Engineering and Outlier removal as done in the EDA project on the same dataset [Link](https://github.com/laksharora98/Analytics-Vidhya/tree/main/EDA%20on%20NYC%20Taxi%20Trip%20Duration)
* Creating dummy variables
* Normalising data
* Scaling data
* Full Linear Regression Model
* Full Ridge Regression Model
* Full Lasso Regression Model
* Comparison between the three full models
* Variance Inflation Factor Analysis
* Reverse Feature Elimination
* Lasso Regression with limited features
* Comparison of all models
